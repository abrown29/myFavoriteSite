# myFavoriteSite
For this project I used the Cuyahoga County Public Library as my website.
I started by trying to match the color of the navigation bar as well as all the links.
Next I moved on to the jumbotron and used a background image.
The real website has a number of carousels, but for the one in the jumbotron I used a video instead.
A search bar is also inclided in the jumbotron.
Below that I created a number of columns that included a number of links to relevant information.
